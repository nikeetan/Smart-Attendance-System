# Smart Attendance System

## Overview

The **Smart Attendance System** is an innovative solution designed to automate and streamline the process of attendance management in educational institutions and workplaces. Traditional attendance systems are often time-consuming, prone to human error, and difficult to maintain. This project leverages **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** technology and a custom mobile application to create a seamless, automated attendance system that reduces manual effort and improves accuracy.

The system uses smartphones as BLE beacons, eliminating the need for additional hardware. Gateways installed in classrooms or meeting rooms capture BLE signals from students' or employees' smartphones, and the data is processed on a server to mark attendance automatically. The system also provides a user-friendly dashboard for managing sessions, viewing attendance reports, and sending notifications.

## Key Features

1. **Automated Attendance Tracking**:
    - Attendance is marked automatically based on the BLE signals emitted by students' smartphones.
    - No manual intervention is required, saving time and reducing errors.
2. **Smartphone as BLE Beacon**:
    - Students or employees can use their smartphones as BLE beacons by installing a custom app.
    - This eliminates the need for additional hardware like RFID tags or fingerprint scanners.
3. **User-Friendly Dashboard**:
    - Admins can register themselves, students, and faculty members through a web-based dashboard.
    - Sessions can be scheduled with specific timings, and attendance reports can be generated easily.
4. **Real-Time Session Monitoring**:
    - A live display shows ongoing and upcoming sessions within the next hour.
    - Teachers and admins can view attendance status in real-time.
5. **Email Notifications**:
    - At the end of each day, students receive an email with their attendance status for the day.
6. **Customizable Session Management**:
    - Admins can add, delete, or modify sessions, classrooms, and faculty details.
    - Time tables can be added for recurring sessions, reducing the need for daily session creation.
7. **Distance-Based Attendance Validation**:
    - The system uses **RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)** values to determine the proximity of the student to the gateway.
    - Attendance is marked only if the student is within a valid range of the classroom.

## Enhancements Over Traditional Systems

1. **Elimination of Manual Attendance**:
    - The system removes the need for manual roll calls or attendance sheets, reducing human error and saving time.
2. **Cost-Effective Solution**:
    - By using smartphones as BLE beacons, the system avoids the cost of additional hardware like RFID tags or fingerprint scanners.
3. **Scalability**:
    - The system can be easily scaled to accommodate large numbers of students or employees across multiple classrooms or meeting rooms.
4. **Real-Time Data Processing**:
    - Attendance data is processed in real-time, allowing for immediate access to attendance reports and session status.
5. **Customizable and Flexible**:
    - The system allows for easy customization of sessions, classrooms, and faculty details, making it adaptable to different institutional needs.
6. **Enhanced Security**:
    - The use of OTP (One-Time Password) for student registration ensures that only authorized users can register and mark attendance.

## System Architecture

The Smart Attendance System consists of the following components:

1. **BLE Beacon Simulation**:
    - A custom mobile app simulates a BLE beacon, emitting a unique ID for each student.
    - The app is installed on students' smartphones, which act as BLE tags.
2. **Gateways**:
    - Gateways are installed in each classroom or meeting room.
    - They capture BLE signals from students' smartphones and send the data to the server via WiFi.
3. **Node-Red Server**:
    - The server processes the BLE signals and marks attendance based on the RSSI value and beacon ID.
    - The server also handles user registration, session scheduling, and attendance reporting.
4. **Web-Based Dashboard**:
    - Admins and faculty members can access the dashboard to manage sessions, view attendance reports, and register new users.
    - The dashboard is user-friendly and requires no technical expertise.
5. **Email Notifications**:
    - The system sends daily attendance reports to students via email.

## Future Scope

1. **Integration with Face Recognition**:
    - To prevent proxy attendance, the system can be enhanced with face recognition technology.
    - Students would need to verify their identity using facial recognition in addition to BLE signals.
2. **Mobile App for Gateways**:
    - The gateways used to capture BLE signals can be replaced with a mobile app, eliminating the need for additional hardware.
3. **Workplace Application**:
    - The system can be adapted for use in corporate environments to track employee attendance and schedule meetings.
4. **Enhanced Data Analytics**:
    - The system can be integrated with data analytics tools to provide insights into attendance trends, student performance, and resource utilization.
5. **Cloud Integration**:
    - The system can be migrated to a cloud-based platform for better scalability and accessibility.
